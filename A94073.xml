            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

But it is the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>current judgement of our Divines, that it drawes neere an end. While this e≈øtate of the Church la≈øts, their condition will be like that, de≈øcribed by the Prophet, <hi>A day wherein the light ≈øhall neither be cleare nor darke,</hi> Zach. 14.6. full of uncertainties, and ≈øubject to conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuall changes and vici≈ø≈øitudes, not ≈øo light that they ≈øhal ≈øay there is an end of our feares, nor ≈øo darke that they ≈øhall ≈øay there is an end of our hopes. Sometimes they may be under the power of the Enemy, as <hi>pri≈øoners in a pit wherein there is no water;</hi> and by and by God will ray≈øe up a deliverer for them that ≈øhall proclaime their liberty, and be as a <hi>covering Cherub</hi> to the Ark of God, for their defence. A re≈øemblance of this condition of the Church, we have in the Jewi≈øh State, which there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore is made the prototype of all the Gentile Churches thorowout the whole Book of the Revelation, the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phe≈øie of the la≈øt times.</p>
            <p>An embleme whereof you have in the former Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pters. Fir≈øt, the children of I≈ørael did evill in the ≈øight of the Lord, and he gave them into the hand <hi>of Cu≈øhan Ri≈øhathaim the king of Me≈øopotamia,</hi> and hee ruled over them <hi>eight yeeres.</hi> Then the Lord ray≈øed up a delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer to them, <hi>Oihoniel the ≈øonne of Kenaz Calebs yonger brother,</hi> and the Land had re≈øt <hi>forty yeeres.</hi> Then the chilren of I≈ørael did evill againe in the ≈øight of the Lord and he <hi>≈øtrengthned again≈øt them Eglon the king of Moab:</hi> and they ≈øerved him <hi>eighteene yeeres,</hi> and then the Lord ray≈øed up a deliverer for them, <hi>Ehud the ≈øonne of Gera,</hi> and the Land had re≈øt <hi>fowre≈øcore yeeres.</hi> After<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards they were oppre≈ø≈øed by the <hi>Phili≈øtines,</hi> and the
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:161909:5"/>Lord delivered them by <hi>Shamgar the ≈øonne of Anath.</hi> And they did evill againe in the ≈øight of the Lord, and he ≈øold them into the hand of <hi>Iabin king of Canaan,</hi> the mo≈øt potent of all the≈øe enemies; for he had nine hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred Chariots of iron, and twenty yeeres hee <hi>mightily oppre≈ø≈øed I≈ørael.</hi> And then the Lord ray≈øed for their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liverance <hi>Deborah the wife of</hi> Lapidoth, and <hi>Barach the ≈øon of</hi> Abinoham, and gave the enemy into their hands. Thus God never leaves his people in affliction, but pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vides Saviours a≈øwell as Per≈øecutors, not onely hornes, but Carpenters al≈øo to beat them to pieces, Zach. 1.21. A ≈øong of thank≈øgiving for this la≈øt victory and deliverance, is the contents of this Chapter. In which, by way of context, wee may ob≈øerve the≈øe ≈øix particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars, all which will helpe us in the duty of the pre≈øent day.</p>
            <p n="1">1 Fir≈øt, the heart that ≈øhalbe thankfull for a mercy mu≈øt <hi>be gracious:</hi> the ≈øong mu≈øt be ≈øung by a Deborah and a Barak, they mu≈øt have <hi>golden vials,</hi> hearts refined and not dro≈ø≈øie, that ≈øhall have the <hi>harpes of God in their hands,</hi> Revel. 5.8.

            <p n="4">4. Fourthly, he that will be thankfull, mu≈øt enlarge his thoughts by the remembrance of former mercies, and all the circum≈øtances of mercies pre≈øent.

            <p>And you mu≈øt enlarge your thoughts in all the cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cum≈øtances of the pre≈øent mercies; ≈øo doth Deborah, by the violence of the enemy, <hi>the kings came and ≈øought then fought the kings of Canaan in Tanach, by the waters of Megiddo, they tooke no gaine of money.</hi> By their confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent expectations and their hopes. <hi>Why is his chariot ≈øo long a comming, why tarry the wheeles of his chariot? have they not ≈øped? have they not divided the prey to every man a dam≈øell or two? to Si≈øera a prey of divers colours, a prey of divers colours of needle worke of divers colours of needle worke of both ≈øides, meet for the necks of them that take the ≈øpoyle.</hi> By the fal≈øhood and de≈øertion of their friends.

            <p n="5">5. Fifthly, a heart truly thankfull gives the in≈øtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments their due honour: tho≈øe that God hath honoured in the worke, doe you honour al≈øo, and God in them. <hi>Out of Ephraim was there a root of them again≈øt Amalek, after Benjamin among the people, Zebulon and Nephthali were a people that jeoparded their lives unto the death, in the high places of the field Ble≈ø≈øed above women ≈øhall Ia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hel the wife of Heber the Kenite be, ble≈ø≈øed ≈øhall ≈øhe bee a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove women in the Tent.</hi> It is the property of a bea≈øt to crop the Tree that ≈øhelters it, and of an unskilfull ≈øoldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er to di≈ømantle that Towne that mu≈øt defend him.

            <p n="6">6. Sixthly, mercies received with pray≈øes, mu≈øt be followed with prayers. As prayer ≈øhould engage the heart to pray≈øe, ≈øo pray≈øes ≈øhould encourage the heart to prayer; and tho≈øe pray≈øes are heartle≈ø≈øe and faithles, that doe not end in prayers; for when God is giving, is our fitte≈øt ≈øea≈øon to be asking. So heere pray≈øe for a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liverance from one enemy, drawes out the hearts in

            </p>
            <p>Thus we are come home to the Text. The particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars thereof are three.</p>
            <p n="1">1. The per≈øons prayed again≈øt, Gods enemies, with their note of univer≈øality, All thine enemies.</p>

            <p>It is a que≈øtion the Schoolmen u≈øually put, <hi>Num Deus po≈øsit odio haberi?</hi> Whether it be po≈ø≈øible for the creature to be an enemy to God, who is goodne≈ø≈øe it ≈øelfe, ≈øeeing evill onely is the object of hatred, which is not to be found in him? It is an≈øwered, That as God is <hi>bonum univer≈øale,</hi> hee cannot bee hated by the creature; but <hi>inparticulari,</hi> being a good, that is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to us, ≈øo men doe hate the Lord. For Men and Angels in their fall, as ≈øome Schoolemen ob≈øerve, lo≈øt three things in re≈øpect of God; <hi>Delectationem pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chritudinis, adorationem Maje≈øtatis, imitationem bonitatis,</hi> They neyther delight in his beauty, nor adore his glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, nor imitate his goodne≈ø≈øe. Thus all men by nature are <hi>Gods enemies.</hi> But the enemies heere ≈øpoken of, are I≈øraels enemies, enemies to God in his Church, as P≈øal. 78.1. <hi>Let God ari≈øe, and let his enemies be ≈øcattered.</hi> I≈øay

            <p>In the opening of this point there are three things to be explayned.</p>
            <p>Fir≈øt, <hi>the Church of God in all ages and places hath met with enemies.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, <hi>that the≈øe enemies are not onely theirs, but Gods.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thirdly, <hi>≈øome ≈øhort di≈øcoveries who the≈øe enemies are.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Fir≈øt, <hi>the Church of God hath from the beginning met with enemies.</hi> For the nature of Chri≈øts kingdome in this world, is to rule in <hi>the mid≈øt of his enemies;</hi> in the world to come, he ≈øhall rule over them. The Apo≈øtle ≈øayth. There is a ≈øchema, <hi>a fa≈øhion of the world that pa≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øeth away:</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 Cor. 7.31.</note> it continues not alwayes in one fa≈øhion; but yet ca≈øt it into what ≈øhape you will, and the Church of God hath alwayes found enemies in it, and u≈øually they have beene <hi>the greate≈øt per≈øons, and the mo≈øt prevayling party.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The≈øe enemies are of two ≈øorts; from without, or from within. While the Church was wandring among the Heathen, as <hi>≈øheepe among wolves,</hi> what el≈øe could be expected? When I≈ørael went downe into Aegypt, they met with a <hi>Leviathan,</hi> who by cruelty and ≈øubtilty ≈øought to de≈øtroy them:
<note place="margin">P≈ø. 74.14.</note> and when they came into the Land of Canaan, they were as a <hi>≈øpeckled bird,</hi> all the bordering Nations hated them.
<note place="margin">Jer. 12.9.</note> There aro≈øe fowre great Monarchies, or principall kingdoms in the world, called <hi>Bea≈øts,</hi> Dan. 7.1.2. chiefly for their cruelty to
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:161909:8"/>the Saints. Under the Chaldean Monarchy, <hi>I≈ørael is as a ≈øcattered ≈øheepe;</hi> the Lions have driven him away: the former Kings of A≈ø≈øyria, Tiglath Pile≈øer and Salmana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øer have devoured him: and Nebuchadnezzar King of Babylon hath <hi>broken his bones,</hi> Jer. 50.17. In the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øian Monarchy, there was an Haman and a Cambi≈øes, who with a Samaritan faction of their neighbours, that were neyther Heathens by profe≈ø≈øion, nor Jewes by Religion, the≈øe ray≈øed a great mountaine again≈øt them,
<note place="margin">Zach. 4.7.</note> even the power of the whole Empire. In the Grecian Monarchy, there aro≈øe Antiochus, <hi>that little horne,</hi> a King of a fierce countenance, who did de≈øtroy wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, and pro≈øpered and practi≈øed again≈øt the <hi>holy people,</hi> waxed great even <hi>to the ho≈øt of heaven,</hi> and ca≈øt downe <hi>≈øome of the ho≈øt and of the ≈øtarres to the ground and ≈øtamp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on them,</hi> Dan. 8.9.10.</p>
            <p>And in the fourth Monarchy as Pagan, there was a great red Dragon, that made warre again≈øt <hi>Michael and his Angels.</hi> Thus the Church of God hath alwayes met with enemies round about. But yet ≈øhe might ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect friends within, that tho≈øe borne in her bo≈øome and brought up upon her knee, that they ≈øhould be true and faythfull to her. But heere is the mi≈øery, that ≈øhe hath alwayes found the wor≈øt enemies to proceed out of her owne bowels. Toads, they ≈øay are mo≈øt poy≈øonous in the wine≈øeller, and the tares mo≈øt de≈øtructive that grow among the wheat.</p>

<pb n="36" facs="tcp:161909:22"/>God,</hi> and ye will but meet with your owne de≈øtruction in the end.</p>
            <p>To enforce this Admonition, let the≈øe <hi>con≈øiderations</hi> be duely weighed.</p>
            <p>Fir≈øt, for God to give a man up to a ≈øpirit of emnity, and oppo≈øition to his people, is the greate≈øt <hi>≈øpirituall judgement</hi> that can befall a man in this life: it is the <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils cur≈øe</hi> to be the <hi>envious man,</hi> the <hi>accu≈øer</hi> and the <hi>per≈øecutor</hi> of the brethren: and the more a mans heart is turned again≈øt the Saints the more fully doth this cur≈øe take place upon him. It was the great <hi>≈øpirituall judgement</hi> upon Aegypt, and a mo≈øt dangerous fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>runner of their utter de≈øtruction, <hi>P≈øal.</hi> 105.25. It is commonly demanded by Interpreters on that place, how God is ≈øaid to <hi>turne the hearts of men to hate his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple?</hi> and it is commonly an≈øwered, as in the ca≈øe of hardning <hi>Pharoahs</hi> heart: men <hi>turne</hi> their owne heerts again≈øt Gods people <hi>≈øinfully,</hi> and God turnes them <hi>ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicially, di≈øerved,</hi> by for≈øaking them, leaving them to the power of Satan, and the rage of their owne ≈øpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, <hi>&amp; media di≈øponendo,</hi> ≈øo ordering and di≈øpo≈øing ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects and occa≈øions, as to draw out their rage, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice again≈øt his people. The greate≈øt ≈øpirituall judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is a <hi>hard heart,</hi> and of this <hi>hardne≈ø≈øe</hi> there are ≈øe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verall degrees; but of them all two are the highe≈øt, to <hi>≈øit downe in the chaire of the ≈øcorner, and in the throne of the per≈øecutor.</hi> This did fill up the mea≈øure of <hi>Pharoahs</hi> hardne≈ø≈øe, Exod. 10 28. <hi>Take heed to thy ≈øelfe, ≈øee my face no more; for in the day thou ≈øee≈øt my face thou ≈øhalt dye:</hi> how would it make a mans heart tremble, to con≈øider how far, at this time, this judgment is powred out upon this Nation?</p>
            <p>Secondly, what≈øoever any man doth in oppo≈øition to the Saints, he is <hi>a ve≈ø≈øell of di≈øhonour</hi> in all tho≈øe
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:161909:22"/>workes: it is the ≈øame ≈øervice in which the Devills are imployd, and <hi>God hates them</hi> when he doth imploy them: <hi>The A≈ø≈øyrian the rod of mine anger,
<note place="margin">E≈øay. 10, 5, 12 24.</note> and the ≈øtaffe of mine indignation: I ≈øend him again≈øt an hypocriticall Nation, again≈øt the people of my wrath; and I give him a charge to take the ≈øpoyle, and to tread them downe like the mire of the ≈øtreets:</hi> and this charge of God he doth execute to the utmo≈øt; but was the Lord well plea≈øed therewith? he ≈øaith <hi>when he had performed his whole worke upon Zion, the indignation ≈øhould cea≈øe, and his anger in his de≈øtruction:</hi> and it's a hard ≈øervice to be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed in that which brings forth neither acceptance nor reward, but indignation and de≈øtruction in the end.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, your very oppo≈øition will prove your de≈øtruction; <hi>the pit that you dig</hi> for the Saints yee ≈øhall ≈øurely <hi>fall into,</hi> it is a worke that ever ended in the ruine of the Actors, <hi>E≈øay.</hi> 59.5. It's ≈øaid of wicked men, <hi>that they hatch cockatrice egges, and they weave a ≈øpiders webbe, the webbe never becomes a gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and the egges cur≈øed breakes into a Viper:</hi> it ≈øets forth two properties, and fruits of al the labours of the workers of iniquity; they are unprofitable, they attaine not their end in them, and they are <hi>de≈øtructive,</hi> they bring forth a Viper that ≈øtings him to death that hatch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it, and the wrath of God will never be pacified, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing once provoked, till it end in their utter overthrow, <hi>Zach.</hi> 6.8. when the Angels as in≈øtruments of vengeance went into the north Countrey <hi>≈øc.</hi> into <hi>Per≈øia</hi> and <hi>Chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dea;</hi> and they have quieted my ≈øpirit, ≈øaith the Lord; that is they pacified my wrath by <hi>executing</hi> vengeance upon the per≈øecutors, the people of my wrath: let me rea≈øon with you a little, was there no other way of ≈øin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning that could bring vengeance enough upon you, and ≈øinke you deepe enough into perdition but ye mu≈øt

            <p n="4">4. Fourthly, your de≈øtruction is neere≈øt when yee are highe≈øt, when your confederacy is ≈øtronge≈øt, and your hopes ray≈øed to the greate≈øt perfection: when the enemy is as ≈ømoake out of a chimney and doth threaten even to darken the Sunne, then ≈øhall they bee ≈øcattered, Ho≈øe 12.3.

The Church is ≈øometimes a great ≈øtone,

               </note> even as a mountayne, and it fils the earth; and then the enemies dare not attempt to burden them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øelves therewith, but ≈øometimes it is a ≈øtone of a le≈ø≈øer ≈øize, and then they are ready to thinke they may carry it away with ca≈øe; whereas though it be not alwayes ≈øo
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:161909:23"/>great, yet it is as heavy, and they finde it ≈øo, for it <hi>breaks them to peeces.</hi> When≈øoever the Church of God is brought low it is in de≈øigne, that their enemies may be en≈ønared and taken.</p>
            <p n="5">5. Fiftly, by the≈øe means ye ≈øhall bring upon your ≈øelves the guilt of all the bloud of the Saints that hath beene ≈øhed in former ages. To reade of the cruelty of Pharaoh, Nebuchadnezzar, Antiochus, the Iewes in crucifying the Lord of Life, and of the ten bloudy Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øecutors, and the rage of Antichri≈øt ≈øurpa≈ø≈øing all the≈øe; and to have all this bloud lie upon one generation, who would not tremble at it? But yet all the bloud of for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer times will come upon the per≈øecutors of this la≈øt age of the world. Matth. 23.34.35. <hi>That upon you may come all the righteous bloud ≈øhed upon the earth, from the bloud of righteous Abel, unto the bloud of Zacharias the ≈øon of Barachias.</hi> It is much que≈øtioned how this is to bee under≈øtood, that the bloud ≈øhed in one age ≈øhould in the guilt of it come upon another, and how the bloud of all former ages ≈øhould come upon this la≈øt?</p>
            <p>To under≈øtand it rightly, the≈øe two things are to bee con≈øidered.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Fir≈øt, that it is to be under≈øtood only in re≈øpect of temporall puni≈øhments and not of eternall; for as no man ever went to heaven by the righteou≈øne≈ø≈øe of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther meere man, ≈øo no man ≈øhall ever goe to hell for the wickedne≈ø≈øe of another. Heere the ≈øonne ≈øhall not bear the iniquity of the father, but the ≈øoule that ≈øinnes ≈øhall die. Yet in things temporall, as children may have ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ble≈ø≈øings, as a reward of their fathers graces and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience (as God brought I≈ørael into Canaan,
<note place="margin">2. Cron. 20.7.</note> although they were a very di≈øobedient and ≈øtiffenecked people, becau≈øe it was the Land which he had promi≈øed to A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham his friend: and hee delivered them in the dayes

<note place="margin">E≈øay. 37.35.</note> as a puni≈øhment of their fathers di≈øobedience: the Lord heerein u≈øing his ≈øoveraignty and prerogative to puni≈øh a man eyther in his per≈øon or his po≈øterity,
<note place="margin">Gen. 9, 25. 2 King 5, 27.</note> as he did Cham in Canaan his ≈øon, and Gehe≈øie both in his per≈øon and in his ≈øeede al≈øo.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Secondly, God lookes upon a generation or ≈øuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce≈ø≈øion of men as a body, and in the puni≈øhment of their ≈øinnes he doth ≈øhew both ju≈øtice and providence. As there is a mea≈øure of iniquity in particular men to bee filled up before eternall wrath ≈øhall take hold of them,
<note place="margin">Jer. 51, 13. Dan. 8, 23. Zach. 5.6. Joel. 3, 13. Rev. 14, 15.</note> ≈øo is there a mea≈øure appointed al≈øo to a State, or a ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration of men, which mu≈øt be filled up before Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall wrath ≈øhall come upon them. Wee ≈øee the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall judgement upon the Amorites is deferred, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cau≈øe their <hi>iniquity was not yet full,</hi> and the time to fill it up was 400 yeeres, Gen. 15.16. The Lords Decree is gone forth to <hi>blot out the remembrance, of Amalecke from under heaven,</hi> Exod. 17.14. and yet this people doe not come up into remembrance before the Lord to their utter de≈øtruction till the dayes of Saul, 1 Sam. 15.2. and then the Lord ≈øits upon their po≈øterity their fathers ≈øinnes, <hi>becau≈øe they layd wayt for I≈ørael in the way when they came out of Egypt.</hi> So Chri≈øt ≈øayth to the Phari≈øes; <hi>ye are the children of them that killed the Prophets, fill yee up the mea≈øure of your fathers,</hi> Matth. 23.31.32. So that when children walke on in their fathers wayes, and fill up their mea≈øure, though in re≈øpect of eternall wrath inflicted upon their per≈øons, they were in hell many yeeres agoe, and received a ju≈øt recompence of reward, yet the temporal puni≈øhment may be re≈øerved for after ages, and vi≈øited upon the po≈øterity when tran≈øgre≈ø≈øion is come to the full. Thus all the cruelty executed upon
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:161909:24"/>the Saints from the bloud of Abel was vi≈øited upon the Jewes in the de≈øtruction of Jeru≈øalem, and all the bloud ≈øhed upon the earth ≈øhall be vi≈øited upon Babylon the great the mother of harlots, when ≈øhe ≈øhall come up in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to remembrance before God, with all tho≈øe that have receyved her marke, or borne her image, or acted with her in a way of bloud.</p>
            <p n="6">6. Sixthly, there are no ≈øort of ≈øinners in who≈øe de≈øtruction the Lord doth ≈øo much delight; it is unto him a ≈øacrifice of a ≈øweet ≈øavour, E≈øa. 34.6. Jer. 46.10. Z<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

            <p>My purpo≈øe is not to give you tho≈øe ordinary ≈øup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports which are common to all afflictions, as that they come from a fathers hand, from a heart full of love, that they ≈øhalbe in mea≈øure, and make a man partaker of the holine≈ø≈øe of God in the end, for this is all the fruit to take away the ≈øinne &amp;c. though the≈øe are great grounds to ≈øtay a mans faith upon. But I would rather pitch up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on tho≈øe that might be more proper and peculiar to the enemies and ≈øufferings of the la≈øt times, the cup that God hath re≈øerved for you.</p>
            <p n="1">1. The≈øe ≈øhalbe the la≈øt great ≈øuffrings of the ≈øaints, and they ≈øhalbe but ≈øhort; for as all the former bea≈øts are de≈øtroyed, ≈øo there now remaines onely the ≈øeventh head of the fourth bea≈øt, which is as the eight and mu≈øt goe into perdition, Rev. 17.11. and then all the emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent per≈øecutions of the Church ≈øhall cea≈øe, and there ≈øhall be no more a pricking briar, and a grieving thorne in the Lords holy Mountaine: the Lord ≈øhall then wipe away all teares from your eyes, there ≈øhall bee no more ≈øorrow, nor crying, the witne≈ø≈øes ≈øhall die but once, and it ≈øhalbe the ≈øharpe≈øt but yet the ≈øhorte≈øt of the Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches ≈øufferings. To all you that have beene with the <hi>Lambe called and cho≈øen and faythfull,</hi> I ≈øay as the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyr did, Hold out faith and patience, your worke is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mo≈øt
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:161909:25"/>at an end. It was a great comfort to Hierome of Prague, that he could ≈øay to his per≈øecutors at his death, <hi>Centum revolutis annis Deo re≈øpondebitis &amp; mihi:</hi> after an hundred yeeres God would call them to an account in avenging his bloud; but you may ≈øummon your per≈øecutors before God to an≈øwer in a far le≈ø≈øe time.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Secondly, the≈øe la≈øt ≈øufferings ≈øhall be an inlet to the mo≈øt glorious deliverances that ever the Church of God had: for the killing of the witne≈ø≈øes ≈øhall make way for their re≈øurrection,
<note place="margin">Rev. 11.12.15.</note> when they ≈øhall <hi>a≈øcend to hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven in a cloud, their enemies beholding them.</hi> And then ≈øhall the Kingdomes of the earth become the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes of the Lord, and the dominion under the whole heaven ≈øhall be given to the Saynts of the mo≈øt High,
<note place="margin">Dan 7.27.</note> and they ≈øhall po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øe it for ever and ever.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Thirdly, all your ≈øinfulne≈ø≈øe and unworthines, ≈øhall not hinder your redemption: though the people of God fall, yet they ≈øhall ri≈øe, and though they may ≈øit in darkne≈ø≈øe, the Lord will bee light about them. Indeed the great di≈øcouragements to the Saints are their ≈øinnes, and their unan≈øwerable walking unto meanes and mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies, but yet the Lord cannot alter the word gone out of his lips, nor ≈øuffer his faythfulne≈ø≈øe to fayle, E≈øay 10.27. <hi>The burden ≈øhall bee taken away from off thy ≈øhoulder, and the yoke from off thy necke, and the yoke ≈øhall bee de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtroyed, becau≈øe of the annointing.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Gla≈ø≈ø. Rhetor ≈øacr.

Their ≈øinnes may procure their affliction, but they ≈øhall never hinder their redemption.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Fourthly, The enemies ≈øhall never bee able to ≈øet up Popery in this kingdome againe, and to e≈øtabli≈øh
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:161909:26"/>any of tho≈øe things that relate to it; that the Lord hath removed in the≈øe late yeeres, they ≈øhall never bee able to root out the Saints out of the Reformed Churches, but they ≈øhall grow by their oppo≈øition. Chri≈øt will ≈øurely keepe the ground that hee hath won in a way of Reformation; and what the former vialls have de≈øtroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ≈øhall never be made up againe, for hee will not lo≈øe the fruit of his conque≈øt in any one of them. His ≈øha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kings of heaven and earth are to this end, that hee may remove the things that are ≈øhaken as of things that are made, that tho≈øe things that cannot <hi>be ≈øhaken may remain</hi> Heb. 12.27. There is nothing that is made by man in the things concerning God, but he will have a ≈øhaking time for it, and his end in ≈øhaking it is, that hee may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move it, and he doth not ≈øo remove it, that the enemies ≈øhould againe e≈øtabli≈øh it. And therefore what ever of Popery the Lord hath ≈øhaken and removed, I doe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, that all the power of the enemy ≈øhall never ≈øet up againe. I doe not doubt but there will bee many and de≈øperate attempts for it, but they ≈øhall never bee able to prevayle, as when the Heatheni≈øh way of wor≈øhip was de≈øtroyed, there were many endeavoured to ≈øet it up againe.</p>
            <p>Fiftly, <hi>God will in an e≈øpeciall manner owne you in all your ≈øufferings,</hi> as he calls you forth for him, ≈øo will hee a≈ø≈øuredly appeare for you; and therefore he ≈øaith when men reject them and ca≈øt them out,
<note place="margin">Rev. 11.3.</note> they are <hi>my two wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne≈ø≈øes,</hi> and they ≈øhall have the ≈øame power with him that any of the <hi>ancient Saints</hi> have had in times pa≈øt, they ≈øhall <hi>turne water into bloud</hi> with Mo≈øes and Aaron, they ≈øhall <hi>≈øhut Heaven that it ≈øhall not raine,</hi> with Elijah, they ≈øhall be <hi>two Olive trees ≈øtanding before the God of the earth:</hi> with Jo≈øhua and Zorobabel, if any man hurt them <hi>fire ≈øhall come out of their mouthes and devour them,
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:161909:26"/>and they ≈øhall ≈ømite the earth with plagues as often as they will;</hi> ≈øo that the greater per≈øecution they ≈øhall meet with all from men the nearer <hi>acce≈ø≈øe</hi> they ≈øhall have to God and the greater <hi>acceptance</hi> with him, and as the <hi>affliction</hi> ≈øhall abound, ≈øo ≈øhall al≈øo the <hi>con≈øolation,</hi> and to be owned eminently by God, and to be looked upon as tho≈øe of whom the world is not worthy, when they are di≈øowned by men and accounted not worthy to live in the world, is a great meanes to beare up mens ≈øpirits in the greate≈øt ≈øufferings.</p>
